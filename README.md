Sanil Doshi - Actual Code

(we had trouble getting it to run on a different computer so it was easier to do all the code on one)


## To run:
```bash
Open file UList.xcodeproj inside the folder /UList.
Hit the play button at the top left corner.
When the simulation opens you can start editting your lists!
```
